# snake-rl
AI snake game trained using Reinforcement Learning

# How to use it

You can open the notebook on google colab and run all the cells to create your agent and export it to tensorflowjs.


# Example

You can see the agent running live on the browser on the link below

The snake on the link above does not grow when it gets the food piece.
This was doen so it might run for a longer time in order to showcase the agent.
However, you might be able to do it with the snake growing as well
